5</span>BESSBROOK AND ITS LINEN MILLS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> the times in which we live are
out of joint is a truism too obvious to require comment.&nbsp; As
much now as in old days the cry is, &ldquo;Who will show us any
good?&rdquo;&nbsp; We hear much of modern progress; but there are
many who, like Mr. Froude, intimate that what we call progress is
in reality merely change, and that change is not necessarily
always for the better.&nbsp; When such men as Mr. Ruskin leave
the domain of the beautiful fiercely to arraign what in our
wisdom, or want of it, we term Political Economy and its pitiless
laws, we may be sure that all the social problems of the age have
not been satisfactorily solved.&nbsp; If it be true that our rich
men are becoming richer every day, it is equally true that our
poor are becoming poorer.&nbsp; Might has taken from the peasant
his strip of land, and has driven him into the towns, where he
dies of bad air, bad water, bad food, bad lodging, bad pay; where
his sons learn crime, and his daughters how much better rewarded
is vice than virtue.&nbsp; Underneath the whited sepulchres of
our boasted civilisation there lie rottenness and dead
men&rsquo;s bones.&nbsp; Of talk we have somewhat more than
enough, as must necessarily be the case now that woman claims to
appear on the platform on an equality with <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>man.&nbsp;
Associations of all kinds exist partly for the bettering and
partly for the bewildering of the public.&nbsp; Money is freely
subscribed for them; for Dives has a dim idea that he owes much
to Lazarus, and would at all times rather discharge the debt by
letting a few crumbs fall from the table, than by personally
clothing his naked form and binding up his loathsome sores.&nbsp;
It is not clear that we have improved on that very much.&nbsp; It
is clear that for lack of it we have a great
deal&mdash;especially in our crowded manufacturing
districts&mdash;of social anarchy&mdash;of progress the wrong
way&mdash;of licence which means licentiousness, of teaching and
talking downward rather than upward.&nbsp; The need of silent
divine action, as Thomas Carlyle writes, is very great at this
time.</p>
<p>In Ireland, in one spot in particular, this silent divine
action has now been in progress some twenty years, and the result
is worth noting.&nbsp; I write of Mr. Richardson&rsquo;s
Flax-spinning Mills at Bessbrook, a model town near Newry, and
not far from the headquarters of Ireland&rsquo;s principal source
of wealth, the linen trade.</p>
<p>A few words as to this trade may not be out of place
here.&nbsp; The art of weaving is of great antiquity.&nbsp; In
Ireland for many years attention has been paid to this branch of
industry.&nbsp; Its linen manufacture has existed from the
earliest period.&nbsp; In the reign of Charles I. the Earl of
Strafford caused flax seed to be brought from Holland, and
induced manufacturers from France and Holland to settle in the
country.&nbsp; After the Restoration the trade was firmly
established.&nbsp; From 1711 to 1832 it was placed under
Government <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>patronage.&nbsp; In former times the weaver was superior
in social status to most other workpeople, and he enjoyed special
privileges.&nbsp; He was exempt, for instance, from serving on
juries, and, except under peculiar circumstances, could not be
forced to join the army.&nbsp; Many of the old Irish squires as
well as the sons of landed chiefs were taught to weave, and even
as late as the last century there were numbers of such weavers in
Ulster.&nbsp; Indeed in that district everything was done that
could be done to develop this important industry.&nbsp; During
the long period of Lord Moira&rsquo;s residence at Montalto, he
gave all possible encouragement to his tenants in stimulating the
growth of flax.&nbsp; He had a dinner prepared every Thursday for
the cloth buyers who attended Ballynahinch Market, and on these
occasions we are told that his lordship sat at the head of the
table and listened to the trade gossip about yard-wides and
seven-eights, with all the zest of one who had become personally
interested in the rise or fall of goods.&nbsp; In a similar
spirit the Earl of Hillsborough, at that time a leading
statesman, readily exercised his senatorial influence as well as
his baronial power.&nbsp; Lord Hertford was also very friendly in
every way where his aid could be of advantage.&nbsp; In 1765,
when he held the office of Irish Viceroy, he obtained from the
Linen Board many concessions in favour of the Northern merchants,
and his influence at Court was successfully used to obtain royal
patronage for the Lisburn Damask works.&nbsp; A large lot of
goods was specially got up for the royal table, the fame of this
damask rapidly rose after the accomplishment of the royal order,
and not only the <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>leading peers of Great Britain, but several of the
Continental potentates, sent to Lisburn for their goods.&nbsp; In
many ways public-spirited men sought to improve their machinery
in order that they might be able to produce a better class of
goods.&nbsp; About the time when James Quinn was stirring up the
latent taste for the fanciful in damask-weaving and giving the
people of Lurgan new ideas as to what could be accomplished in
working patterns with the shuttle, James Bradshaw, the son of an
independent landowner, who resided near Newtownards, was paying
great attention to the diaper trade, then carried on in that town
with considerable spirit, though at that time the Irish looms
were beaten by those of Holland and the Continent.&nbsp; Mr.
Bradshaw was determined to find out the secret of that
superiority.&nbsp; As an amateur weaver, he had taken much
interest in the improvement of weaving machinery, and seen its
defects.&nbsp; One morning in 1728 he left his home in Ulster,
and for two years afterwards no one of his family or friends knew
anything of his whereabouts.&nbsp; Immediately after leaving
home, he assumed the style of dress usually worn by weavers, and
set out for Holland, but at the end of several weeks&rsquo;
travel by sea and land, he found himself, instead, in Hamburg,
where he engaged with a diaper manufacturer, and at once
commenced work.&nbsp; While so employed he paid the most diligent
attention to all he saw, both as to the style of weaving, the
fittings of looms, and the peculiar description of yarns chosen
for certain classes of goods.&nbsp; All the time young Bradshaw
remained in Hamburg he was obliged to keep up the <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>garb and
character of an ordinary workman, as such was the jealousy of the
trade there, that had it been known that he had merely come among
them for the purpose of finding out the secret of the
manufacture, his life might have fallen a sacrifice.&nbsp; At
length, having mastered the details and gained ample experience
of the practical department of diaper-making, he thought of
returning home, which he did, by the aid of friends.&nbsp; In
1730, he arrived safely at Newtownards, a town which has since
become famous as the Paisley of Ulster.&nbsp; Soon after his
return, Mr. Bradshaw had looms constructed on the improved
principle.&nbsp; He personally inspected the mode of fitting them
up, and had all the gearing made on the plan so popular in
Hamburg.&nbsp; The effect of all this was, we are told, to
introduce a superior system of production, and to give life to
the diaper trade, not only in Newtownards, but throughout other
parts of Downshire.</p>
<p>Thus the linen trade flourished and became more important
every year; of this importance Belfast may be considered as the
outward and visible sign; every one knows that, in consequence of
its being the seat of the linen trade, it has become the most
prosperous town in Ireland.&nbsp; Its mills, factories, and
docks, combine the commercial and mercantile features both of
Liverpool and Manchester.&nbsp; Its situation is most
picturesque&mdash;its streets are broad and uniform.&nbsp; Some
of the linen-warehouses are palaces, and nowhere in the world are
there finer buildings, more attractive shops, and greater
symptoms of prosperity and wealth.&nbsp; It is not merely the
seat of shipping, of commerce, of manufacture, <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>but its
intellectual claims are of no common character.&nbsp; It calls
itself the Irish Athens, and its colleges, and libraries, and
newspapers, and general intelligence, bear out in some degree
that claim.&nbsp; The linen trade of Ulster now represents a
capital of several millions, and employs men, women, and
children.</p>
<p>What has developed it to its enormous extent has been the
application of steam.&nbsp; No longer the weaver sits in his
isolated cottage.&nbsp; He is a hand in a mill, and weaving is a
complex affair, requiring, to make it pay, gigantic operations
and many hands.&nbsp; The factory system has many disadvantages,
which tend to the mental, moral, and physical deterioration of
the hands engaged in it.&nbsp; I write of one of the most
successful efforts that has yet been made to free the factory of
them, and to carry it on in a way advantageous, not only to the
employer, but the employed.&nbsp; For these purposes it is
necessary that the factory be an isolated one; that it should be
a community by itself, an <i>imperium in imperio</i>, governed by
its own laws, with its own special educational, religious, and
philanthropic establishments; and that, above all things, it
should be conducted on the principle, or rather practice, of
total abstinence from all intoxicating drinks.&nbsp; I heard the
Rev. Kegan Paul say at a temperance meeting, held in Exeter Hall
this year, that in some parts of Dorsetshire, the county in which
he resided, there were parishes with no public-houses in them,
that in these parishes there were no paupers, that no cases came
from them to the Petty-Sessions, and that the answer given by
policeman, when asked by the <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>magistrates whether he had ever taken
a teetotaller into custody, was &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; From many
other districts in England, Scotland, and Ireland, a similar
testimony reaches us.&nbsp; From all the judges of the land, from
all our clergy, from all our prisons and
penitentiaries&mdash;affirmation, mournful in its monotony,
reminds us that drink is the bane of the working-man.&nbsp; This
is confessed by all, whether they be temperance reformers or
not.&nbsp; In many cases it is found that the higher the wages
earned by the operative, the more drunken and dissipated are his
habits.&nbsp; No fact has been more conclusively
established.&nbsp; Where you shut up the public-house, the
gin-palace and the beer-shop, you have less pauperism and crime,
more honest, decent, sober living, than you have where these
places are open.&nbsp; If this be true in England, where the
people are more phlegmatic and less wild on politics and
religion, it is trebly true of Ireland, where the people are
supposed to be at all times too passionate and ready to take
offence; where ages of political and religious partisanship have
given to those passions an unnatural ferocity; and where the drop
o&rsquo; drink seems to be especially potent in its
working.&nbsp; I have travelled in most parts of England,
Scotland, and Europe, but I never felt in the slightest peril
from the character of my travelling companions.&nbsp; I have been
very little in Ireland, but the most disagreeable journeys I ever
made were on Irish railways.&nbsp; In each case the
disagreeableness arose entirely from the extent to which my
fellow-passengers had indulged in the national drink.&nbsp;
Perhaps we get it adulterated in England.&nbsp; If so, we have
reason to be <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>thankful.&nbsp; Its effects on the Irish are, for the
time, truly demoniacal.&nbsp; I have never seen people so
maddened with drink as those of the sister isle.&nbsp; The
temperate character of Bessbrook strikes you at once.&nbsp; There
the difficult problem of carrying out a factory with the minimum
of inevitable evil seems to have been satisfactorily solved.</p>
<p>Where is Bessbrook?&nbsp; The answer is, you pass it as you
travel by rail from Belfast to Dublin, a little more than fifty
miles from the latter, a little more than thirty from the former
place&mdash;close to the Newry station on the main line.&nbsp; By
day and night it is visible, and testifies afar-off the industry
of which it is the source and centre.&nbsp; About half a mile to
your right you can just discern its lofty chimneys and gigantic
works.&nbsp; By night the place looks like a palace of glass, as
the cheerful light, eloquent of labour and capital and
intelligence, shines out of its thousand windows.&nbsp; We get
out of the train, and ascend the road on our right.&nbsp; If it
be daytime we shall have a pleasant walk.&nbsp; Behind us is
Newry, or rather the valley in which it is seated, where its
merchants and tradesmen sell and buy and get gain; and the river
with its ships, which trade to Liverpool and all parts of our
English coast.&nbsp; On our left and right are mountains and
hills, well planted with white cottages and farmers&rsquo;
houses, which look smilingly at us in the morning sun.&nbsp; The
interiors, we admit, may be capable of improvement.&nbsp; Many of
them are of the rudest kind, with the bare earth for the floor,
with stone walls, whose sides internally are black with the smoke
of the peat fire, which is painfully manifested to the
unaccustomed <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>and curious stranger who inquires within.&nbsp; The
inhabitants are all small farmers.&nbsp; They grow flax and
potatoes, keep a cow or a goat, and poultry and pigs, the sale of
which is their living.&nbsp; As for themselves, they never touch
such delicacies, and live chiefly on potatoes and Indian
meal.&nbsp; They are very dirty.&nbsp; Muck of all kinds
surrounds their dwellings, and yet they seem to thrive, and the
shoeless, unwashed, ragged boys and girls you meet up there, have
faces and figures you often seek in vain amongst more civilised
people and in more comfortable homes.&nbsp; They have a hard time
of it.&nbsp; In their dreary cabins wretchedness seems to reign
supreme.&nbsp; At the outside, a couple of rooms comprise the
whole extent of the building devoted to the human biped, and he
is but little better lodged than his cow or pig&mdash;that is
all.&nbsp; Nevertheless, you can&rsquo;t get the tenant to
abandon his holding, for which he pays to take possession a great
deal more than you would think it really worth, the rent of which
is often high, and is generally scraped together with much
difficulty and after considerable delay.&nbsp; To be behindhand
with the rent is no uncommon thing in these parts, and a stranger
up yon hills is viewed with considerable suspicion.&nbsp; It can
be no good that takes him up there&mdash;such is the firm belief
of the natives.&nbsp; No power on earth is able to get them to
give up their mountain freedom and frugal fare for better living
elsewhere.&nbsp; Here, at least, the Irishman is too
contented.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He sees his little lot the lot of all;<br
/>
Sees no contiguous palace rear its head<br />
To shame the meanness of his humble shed;<br />
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>No costly
lords the sumptuous banquet deal<br />
To make him loathe his vegetable meal;<br />
But calm, and bred in ignorance and toil,<br />
Each wish, contracting, fits him to the toil.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we wend our way, a fine breeze meets us from the distant
downs.&nbsp; You can fancy the sportsman may find on the distant
heather something that may repay his toil, or the artist
something he may love to transfer to his canvas; but you would
never guess that in so romantic a spot there was so unpoetic a
thing as a flax-spinning mill.&nbsp; On our right runs a little
stream, which, ere it reaches its destination in Newry, sets more
mills going, considering the distance, than any other in the
country.</p>
<p>A turn in the road, and we are at Bessbrook Mills.&nbsp; As we
descend we see the works in all their extent, and the rising
slope beyond, on which is planted the town in which the workmen
live.&nbsp; &ldquo;What an admirable situation!&rdquo; you
exclaim; and truly you are right.&nbsp; No poisonous exhalations
load the air; all seems cheerful and healthy.&nbsp; Here you see
a picture of factory life without factory abominations.&nbsp; No
policeman is required to keep order, for you see no public-house
to create disorder.&nbsp; The head of the place is a
teetotaller.&nbsp; Most of the leading men in the concern are the
same.&nbsp; There is no law to compel the workpeople to be such,
but most of them are so, and great is the comfort of the wives
and families in consequence, as most people are fully aware of
the fact that the worst thing a working-man can do with his money
is to spend it in the gin-palace or the public-house.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>What
immediately strikes the stranger is the substantial and
comfortable appearance of the mill and its surroundings.&nbsp; At
Bessbrook each house consists of from three to five rooms,
according to the size of the family occupying it.&nbsp; Every
arrangement necessary to promote cleanliness and health is
resorted to.&nbsp; As you pass up, some of the first buildings
you come to are the schoolrooms, which are for girls and boys,
and for lads in the evening who are engaged during the day.&nbsp;
The infant-school attached is the most interesting feature; but
you will be pleased with the clean appearance of the boys and
girls&mdash;with their intelligence and readiness to learn.&nbsp;
The staff of masters and mistresses employed is evidently
superior.&nbsp; This school is on the Irish national system, that
is, it is <i>undenominational</i>, and people need but examine
the results of these schools to prove the real value of
unsectarian education bringing all classes together, and trusting
to the Sabbath schools for religious instruction.&nbsp; Every
householder has to send his children there, or whether he sends
them or not he is charged a penny for the schooling of each
child.&nbsp; &pound;100 is subscribed annually, I believe, by the
mills, and there is, besides, a Government grant.&nbsp; The
playground attached to the school is an extensive one, and the
view from it very fine.</p>
<p>A few doors further on, and we come to the Dispensary.&nbsp;
There are ills to which all flesh is heir, and to remove which
the services of a medical man are required.&nbsp; In Ireland the
county is divided into districts, and the services of a medical
man are given gratuitously; but this is pauperism, and the hands
at <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Bessbrook are not paupers.&nbsp; All here are expected
to subscribe to a medical club, and the Firm supplement the
subscription with a handsome one of their own.</p>
<p>Thus a doctor is secured, who comes to his Dispensary on
certain days of the week, and who also, of course, visits the
serious cases in their own homes.</p>
<p>Further on, we come to a building which we ascertain to be the
Temperance Hotel.&nbsp; This is the club and newsroom of the
place.&nbsp; In the winter-time it is highly popular.&nbsp; Many
Irish papers and a few English ones are taken in, and, I may add,
most diligently perused.&nbsp; Here also are <i>Punch</i> and
<i>Zozimus</i>, or the Dublin <i>Punch</i>.&nbsp; There also
chess and draughts are played, and smoking is permitted.&nbsp;
Boys are here indulging in games, while the advanced politician
has his favourite organ&mdash;Conservative or Liberal; and those
who care for neither, discuss matters connected with the
neighbourhood, and the state of affairs at home.&nbsp; I may add,
close to the mill itself is a large hall in which refreshments
are provided at a cheap rate for those who come from a
distance.</p>
<p>A little further on, and we come to a square, around which are
workmen&rsquo;s houses, some of them really most eligible
habitations, with a few shops at the end nearest us.&nbsp; One of
them is a co-operative store; another is a milliner&rsquo;s shop,
in which the latest fashions are as much sought after as in
London; and then there is a butcher&rsquo;s shop, a
baker&rsquo;s, a general shop, and a post-office.&nbsp; At right
angles to the right of the principal street are two or three more
streets, which also contain a shop or two; so that the good
people at work here, if they <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>have money to spare, can find little
difficulty in parting with it.&nbsp; A farm of 300 acres,
belonging to the Firm, must also be noted, by means of which that
real luxury, pure milk&mdash;a thing unknown in our great
metropolis&mdash;is placed within the reach of all.&nbsp; There
are allotments in which the householders work on a summer&rsquo;s
evening, and at one end of the town are some better classes of
houses, in which the gentlemen connected with the works or the
estate&mdash;which belongs to the same proprietor&mdash;reside;
just below these spreads out a picturesque sheet of water, which
feeds the mill, and is here useful as well as ornamental.&nbsp;
From thence the ground rises, and you get a good view of the
surrounding hills.&nbsp; On one elevation, just before you enter
the town, there is the Friends&rsquo; Meeting-house, and a
comfortable villa in which Mr. Richardson resides when he visits
the place.&nbsp; Indeed, though he lives some fourteen miles off,
he is not long absent from Bessbrook.&nbsp; He and his wife are
perfectly cognisant of its wants, material and spiritual, and are
ready to relieve them.&nbsp; They feel that it is a serious thing
to have such a community under their care, they realise all the
solemn responsibility of such a charge.&nbsp; Mr. Richardson,
jun., who lives near the works, entertains similar ideas, and
conducts the Sabbath-school&mdash;a very flourishing one, held in
the schoolroom on a Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; A little way out of
the town you may see, near one another, three very
substantial-looking buildings&mdash;one is a Roman Catholic, one
is a Presbyterian, and another is an Episcopalian place of
worship.&nbsp; Let me add, that all these seem well attended, and
that in Bessbrook there is peace and harmony; the rival <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>sects rarely
interfere with each other, because the demon of strong drink
inflames no root of bitterness, and fans no religious animosities
into a fever heat.</p>
<p>I think I have now given an account of all the institutions of
the place, with one exception&mdash;that of the Methodists, who
meet in a temporary little hall, originally a photographic
establishment.&nbsp; They are an infant cause as yet, but Mr.
Richardson has recently granted a site for a place of worship for
their accommodation.&nbsp; Such, then, are the institutions of
Bessbrook.&nbsp; Let me repeat what they are&mdash;the school,
the church, the dispensary, the shop, the reading-room, the
mill.&nbsp; Let me add what they are not&mdash;the
pawnbroker&rsquo;s, the leaving-shop, the ragged-school, the
petty lodging-house to which tramps resort in all our large
towns, the public-house, and consequent police-station.&nbsp;
Does it now dawn on you, intelligent reader, why, in the opinion
of many, Bessbrook is deemed worthy to be called a model
town?</p>
<p>Let me now speak of its origin.&nbsp; The concern has been in
active operation about a quarter of a century.&nbsp; An estate of
six thousand acres belonging to an Irish nobleman was in the
market, and it was purchased by Mr. John G. Richardson, a
wealthy, intelligent, and public-spirited member of the Society
of Friends, partly with a view, of course, to the productive use
of his capital, and partly to give the operative class a chance
of living and working under conditions favourable, and not, as is
too generally the case, opposed, to their physical and moral
welfare.&nbsp; On the estate, on a site admirably adapted for the
purpose, Bessbrook is situated.&nbsp; There <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>is a
beautiful blue granite found in one part of the estate, equal if
not superior to that of Aberdeen as regards appearance and
quality, which is gradually being introduced into England, where
it needs but to be seen to be appreciated.&nbsp; It is now being
used in the Manchester new Town Hall, and as it is better known
we may expect to find it more largely in demand there.&nbsp; As
at the mill, the same law holds good, that no public-house is to
be tolerated.&nbsp; As a natural consequence, as I have already
intimated, the police are unknown.&nbsp; All over the rest of
Ireland you see them&mdash;wonderfully fine fellows, equal to any
Prussians&mdash;the flower of the country&mdash;fully armed and
ever active, as they may well be, for in Ireland there is little
sympathy between the rulers and the ruled; even on the hills
around Bessbrook the peasants illuminated when they heard of
French successes, as if France was to come and fight on their
behalf.&nbsp; There are public-houses around, and they bring with
them the usual curses incident to such institutions among a
people so excitable and passionate as the Irish.&nbsp; In
Bessbrook, and in one or two other districts, the public-house is
forbidden, and consequently the step of the policeman is never
there heard.&nbsp; In its peaceful streets his martial figure is
unknown.&nbsp; The operative has no fines to pay for being drunk
and disorderly, and has no occasion to pawn his Sunday clothes to
procure a meal for his starving family.&nbsp; Teetotallers
flourish.&nbsp; There is a Band of Hope with nearly nine hundred
members, a Temperance Society, and a flourishing society of Good
Templars as well; and occasionally lecturers come there from the
head-quarters in Dublin; <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>but the place itself teaches a lesson
better than any of them, inasmuch as Thomas Carlyle writes,
&ldquo;Silent divine action is better than any amount of speech
or song,&rdquo; and in this point of view the example of
Bessbrook cannot be too much dwelt upon or too widely
proclaimed.&nbsp; As long as the workman drinks it is in vain
that you try to elevate him.&nbsp; I am not speaking of drinking
to excess.&nbsp; As wages are, the workman who is but a moderate
drinker wastes money and time which, if better employed, would
enable him to do better for his family and himself.&nbsp; At
Bessbrook this is clearly felt; the men and women who come there
have no desire to leave it&mdash;the mild despotism of a paternal
government suits them.&nbsp; From the villages all round, even
from as far as Newry, people come to work at the mills.&nbsp;
Tuesday is the day when fresh hands are taken on, and great is
the joy when an application receives an affirmative reply.&nbsp;
The crowd round the door is the best possible test of the
popularity of the place: you get a better idea of its magnitude
when I tell you that it employs upwards of 4,000 hands, and that
it pays away in wages as much as &pound;50,000 a year.&nbsp; I
have said there is little of that troublesome discontent which
seems chronic in Ireland in and around Bessbrook.&nbsp; I might
say more&mdash;I might testify to the existence and skill of the
Volunteer Brass Band, which performs on public occasions, and
whose services are in request even beyond Bessbrook itself.&nbsp;
One great characteristic of the place is the sober and moral air
of the people.&nbsp; In dense communities outside, you hear of
scandals which are rare at Bessbrook; the superior education
given, the absence of <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>intoxicating liquor, have of course
much to do with this.&nbsp; But other agencies are at work.&nbsp;
I refer in the first place to the family system initiated, or at
any rate carried out here; the rule is to take on a whole family
at a time.&nbsp; Here you have no young girls and lads at the
most dangerous periods of their lives freed from parental
control, and thrown uncared-for on the world.&nbsp; Where they
are, we know too well what follows.&nbsp; Our great towns by
night testify to the evils, moral and social, resulting from such
a state of things.&nbsp; At Bessbrook the family is placed in one
or other of the houses built for the operatives, and work is
found for all.&nbsp; If the father cannot work in the mill, he is
set to mend the roads, to work on the farm or at the quarries, to
be a waggoner, or to make himself generally useful: and the
services of such people are in request, as all the repairs of the
mill-gear are done by workmen on the spot.&nbsp; There is no
occasion to go out of the settlement for artificers of any
kind.&nbsp; All the machinery of the place is set in motion by
six engines consuming annually 10,000 tons of coal, which has all
to be brought from Newry, and a water-turbine representing in all
many hundred horse-power.&nbsp; It is clear, then, that
paterfamilias will find plenty to do, and it is equally clear
that the family living on temperance principles will be more
decent, orderly, and comfortable than if the head of it
frequented the public-house.&nbsp; I must say that as regards
personal appearance, the Bessbrook mill-hand may challenge a
comparison with any other mill-hands of a similar class.&nbsp;
Some of the work I should fancy is not of the healthiest, at any
rate there was a heat in some of the rooms, and a dusty condition
of the atmosphere <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>in others, not very desirable, but the hands looked well
nevertheless; and on a Sunday it is scarcely necessary to observe
that they are got up in a style regardless of expense.</p>
<p>Another cause of the good condition of the place may be found
in the reward given under certain conditions to the deserving and
to the saving&mdash;habits induced by the establishment of a
bank, depositors in which receive interest at the rate of five
per cent.&nbsp; That the men appreciate the advantage of such an
institution is clear, when I state that some of them are
depositors to the extent of &pound;300 or &pound;400.</p>
<p>After all, that which mainly distinguishes Bessbrook from
other places of the same kind, are the religious agencies
constantly brought to bear.&nbsp; Mr. Richardson himself is, as
is well known, a member of the Society of Friends, and he and his
lady&mdash;who possess, I may be allowed to state, many admirable
qualifications for such work&mdash;devote much of their time to
the promotion amongst all of the Christian life: but all are free
to worship as conscience dictates; Quakerism has no monopoly of
the place; Roman Catholics and Protestants abound, and the result
is, every operative, with his family, makes a point of attending
some place of worship, and on a Sunday all the churches and
chapels in the district are well filled.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
see at Bessbrook what you may often see elsewhere&mdash;the
intelligent and independent operative lounging about on a Sunday
morning, ragged, unshaven, unwashed, a short pipe in his mouth,
the penny radical newspaper in his pocket, an untaxed and
ill-bred cur at his heels, waiting for <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>the public to open and supply him
with his beloved and pernicious beer.&nbsp; Sunday is a busy day
at Bessbrook.&nbsp; At an early hour the Roman Catholics may be
seen going to mass, and then, as the day wears on, the general
public are visible marching to one place of worship or
another.&nbsp; Few, very few, stop away.&nbsp; All the boys and
the men are at a place of worship&mdash;if the mothers, and the
infirm and the sick, have to stop at home.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
imagine they have got the millennium at Bessbrook, but I feel
justified in saying that there people live in charity with each
other, who, in other parts of Ireland, would be at work cracking
each others&rsquo; skulls.&nbsp; How is this?&nbsp; I reply, the
secret is to be found in the temperance character of the
place.&nbsp; People discuss without the stimulating influence of
the national drink, and the result is they never come to
blows.&nbsp; The nearest public-house, outside the estate, is
called Sebastopol, on account of the fighting of which it is too
often the centre.</p>
<p>There are many week-evening services in Bessbrook, including
mothers&rsquo; meetings and such-like gatherings; Mr. Richardson,
with his wife, as I have already intimated, frequently leaves his
beautiful seat at Moyallen personally to inspect the state, not
merely of the mill as a commercial undertaking, but as an
assemblage of men and women, and young persons and children, who
have bodies to be cared for, and immortal souls to be
saved.&nbsp; To help the backslider, to preserve the unfallen; to
reclaim those who have; to relieve the sick and destitute; to
visit the fatherless and the widow in their affliction, is one
part of a Christian man&rsquo;s duty, faithfully <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>remembered at
Bessbrook.&nbsp; The aim and efforts of the principal are carried
out by a devoted band of ladies and gentlemen connected with the
place, and with the happiest results.&nbsp; I am told that in
five years only three cases of misconduct have occurred.&nbsp;
The discipline of the Roman Catholic Church of course prevents a
great deal of mischief.&nbsp; If the priests do not marry
themselves, they are great promoters of matrimony in other
people.&nbsp; But, after all, they are not all Roman Catholics in
Bessbrook&mdash;indeed, there, the followers of the old religion
are rather in a minority.</p>
<p>Commercially, Bessbrook may be said to be of the first
importance in the linen trade.&nbsp; The produce of its looms
enjoys a world-wide reputation.&nbsp; Such confidence have buyers
in them that, as a London gentleman remarked, &ldquo;You may
purchase them in the dark.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is nothing inferior
in the quality of the Bessbrook linen.&nbsp; It may be pronounced
unsurpassed.&nbsp; What is manufactured there is sold to the
trade, who put their own name to it, and export it to all parts
of the world.&nbsp; The Spanish are customers, and so are the
Americans.&nbsp; The warehouses of London and Belfast and
Manchester are full of linen manufactured at Bessbrook.&nbsp; The
public do not know the name, but the merchants and shippers
do.</p>
<p>Bessbrook is placed in the centre of the flax-growing district
of Ireland, and this is why the linen trade flourishes in that
district.&nbsp; In 1829 the first flax mill was erected at
Belfast, at an expense of nearly &pound;30,000, which, however,
in the course of a few years, was more than repaid.&nbsp; In 1855
it was calculated that <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>no less than 500,000 spindles were at
work, of which more than two-thirds belong to Belfast, affording
occupation to no less than 250,000 hands in the province.&nbsp;
In addition to the flax grown all round, and bought in the
country markets, it is imported from Belgium, France, or the
Baltic, as different qualities are required.</p>
<p>The flax goes through many processes ere it becomes the snowy
damask which adorns your dining-table, or the delicate fabric
which, under the name of linen, ornaments your person.&nbsp; Even
a towel&mdash;as you will see at Bessbrook&mdash;like Rome, was
not made in a day; hence I may say the interior of the mill is
more remarkable that its exterior, imposing and stately as that
is.&nbsp; Outside you see the mere walls, the windows, the lofty
chimney, and, at certain times, streams of men, women, and
children, emerging from it, known in manufacturing districts as
&ldquo;hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; Inside, you feel, directly you have
passed the threshold, that you are in a magic scene of industry,
with its long, long rooms, filled with wonderful machinery
harmoniously working, requiring, in many cases, only the
attendance of a child.&nbsp; By gaslight the scene is
exhilarating.&nbsp; Far, far away is the power which sets all
this machinery in motion, and on it works untiring and as if for
ever.&nbsp; The flax, however, is not fit for spinning and
weaving as it comes to Bessbrook.&nbsp; Even though it comes
there in the scutched state, a great deal has to be done to sort
it and purify it.&nbsp; It is no joke going into a scutching
mill.&nbsp; The dust and noise are hideous.&nbsp; It is bad
enough to see the men and boys hackling it at Bessbrook.&nbsp;
This <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>hackling consists of three processes&mdash;(1)
<i>roughing</i>, performed by roughers, in which the flax is
passed over a course hackle, merely to take out dirt and tow, and
leave the fibres straight; (2) <i>machine hackling</i>, performed
by machinery, attended to by boys of from thirteen to sixteen, in
which the flax is further hackled or combed out; (3)
<i>sorting</i>, performed by men, who are called sorters or
hacklers, whose business it is to hackle the flax as it comes
from the machine, and to sort it in the different
qualities.&nbsp; It is now ready for spinning, and is placed in a
store until required.</p>
<p>The next process is spinning the flax into yarn, which process
consists of two parts: (1) <i>preparing</i>, which is done by
girls, technically termed preparers, back-minders, and rovers;
and (2) <i>spinning</i>, which is done by female spinners.&nbsp;
The yarn, when spun, is sent up to the reeling room to be reeled
into hanks.&nbsp; This work is performed by reelers, also
girls.&nbsp; The yarn is now ready for the market, with the
exception of drying and bunching, which are carried on
elsewhere.</p>
<p>We now ascend to the more important processes.&nbsp; For this
purpose we enter a room where the atmosphere is uncomfortably
warm, and the smell not the most agreeable.&nbsp; Here, men are
at work, steeping the yarn in a mixture which is supposed to
strengthen it, and the secret of which is generally pretty well
kept.&nbsp; Men also are required for other purposes: the yarn is
to be scoured or bleached, as the case may be, and then dried,
and all this work is done by lads or men.&nbsp; As it is not all
light and cheerful employment, most of the work is
downstairs.&nbsp; Joyfully we ascend the big stone <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>staircases
and reach the upper air, where again we admire the beautiful
order and the exquisite machinery; and the neat appearance of the
women and girls employed in this, which is the weaving
factory&mdash;large, airy, and well lighted&mdash;excite our
admiration.&nbsp; I must add, the place is not a little noisy,
with the clack and click, and whirr and whizz, of no end of
looms.&nbsp; Here the first thing done is to wind the yarn on
spools for warp, and pirns for weft.&nbsp; As soon as this is
done, the latter is ready for the shuttle; but the warp has yet
to be wound by girls off the spools, and attached to the
warpers&rsquo; beams.&nbsp; When this is done, it is taken into
the dressing-room, and consigned to the care of men.&nbsp; Four
warpers&rsquo; beams are then and there twisted into one thread,
and that is the one which goes into the looms and which forms the
basis, as it were, of the manufactured article.&nbsp; But the
beam has to submit to another process ere it reach this
consummation.&nbsp; It is again passed into female hands, who
attach to it heddles, or healds, by which the warp is
raised.&nbsp; Now nothing remains but to take it to the weaving
shed, and attach it to the looms, where the yarn is
transmogrified into plain linen, hollands, sheeting, damask, and
towels.&nbsp; The manufacture of damask is exceedingly
interesting.&nbsp; Patterns of great beauty are procured at much
expense.&nbsp; In one part of the mill you come to a large room,
in which the designers, male and female, are at work drawing
designs, and adapting them to the requisite scale.&nbsp; The
patterns are cut out in cardboard.&nbsp; At the top of the loom
there is a wonderful apparatus of little hooks, which as the
cardboard pattern slowly revolves, <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>pull out the requisite needles which
do the bidding of the designer.&nbsp; You almost fancy fairy
fingers must have worked these delicate designs.&nbsp; It is
nothing of the kind.&nbsp; Machinery does it all.&nbsp; All that
human intelligence has to do with the operation is, after the
patterns have been secured in their proper places and machinery
set at work, to see that the threads do not break, and that the
uniform action of all be maintained.&nbsp; What leaves, and
flowers, and garlands, are thus woven into the cloth!&nbsp; They
are very proud of their damask at Bessbrook.&nbsp; No wonder at
it.&nbsp; It is very beautiful, and has no superior in the
trade.</p>
<p>In another part of the premises we find men at work at
hand-looms, some of the beams of which are of immense breadth,
and to move which requires the brawnier hands and firmer muscles
of men.&nbsp; You, perhaps, wonder at this.&nbsp; Naturally the
stranger expects the power-loom to have superseded the
hand-loom.&nbsp; That it has done so, to a great extent, is
evident from the most cursory inspection of Bessbrook, or any
other weaving mill.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the fact remains that the
very finest descriptions of linen are made with hand-looms.&nbsp;
Why is this? you ask.&nbsp; Well, the answer is&mdash;and it is
soon given&mdash;that the finest yarns would be quite unable to
withstand the wear and tear of power-looms urged on by the
resistless impetus of the water-turbine or the
steam-engine.&nbsp; Ah, that machinery!&mdash;so delicate, so
clean, so bright&mdash;can be very cruel!&nbsp; Be a little
careless, a little wild, a little frolicsome, and an accident
will occur in the twinkling of an eye.&nbsp; A mill is a good
schoolmaster.&nbsp; With its unerring action, with its inevitable
laws, with <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>its results, good or bad, immediately following on
action, it is an epitome of the universe.&nbsp; Mill-hands ought
to be a thinking, sober-minded people.&nbsp; At any rate, such
they seemed to me at Bessbrook.</p>
<p>The success of Bessbrook implies something more than a fair
interest for money invested.&nbsp; It means the advancement of
the employed morally and socially.&nbsp; Bessbrook is not, as I
have already said, a mere pecuniary speculation.&nbsp; It is a
grand experiment, intended to show that not merely can the
workman do without his drink, but that he is better without it;
that factory life may be carried on under circumstances
favourable to the training of the children, to the development of
the young, to the comfort and happiness of the advanced in
life.&nbsp; At Bessbrook this experiment is carried out on the
largest scale&mdash;how large, the following facts will
abundantly demonstrate.</p>
<p>It is calculated that the refuse of the place brings in an
income of &pound;1,200 a year.&nbsp; Of course in a flax mill
there is waste.&nbsp; After the flax is hackled and sorted, a
good deal of fluffy flax is rejected.&nbsp; It falls down on the
floor; it flies about in the air.&nbsp; Well, this is all swept
up and sold for what I have stated.&nbsp; Then, again, it must be
remembered that Bessbrook is the name of the head concern, but
that it gives a great deal of employment in the country
around.&nbsp; For instance, a lovely walk under shady trees and
by the side of a bustling little river, under the fine viaduct of
the railway, which takes you, as the case may be, to Dublin or
Belfast, and over one of the hills which glorify this part of the
world, and you come to a place called Craigmore.&nbsp; <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Well, there
is a mill there, and the same process is carried on as at
Bessbrook, only on a smaller scale.&nbsp; At Bessbrook there are
22,000 spindles at work, 500 power-looms, 60 hand.&nbsp; At
Craigmore there are 100 power-looms, that is all.&nbsp; I have
said this is the flax-growing country.&nbsp; Before the flax is
fully ripe it is pulled up by the farmer, and left to dry in the
field.&nbsp; After a day or two it is steeped in ponds, and then,
when dried and scutched, taken to the market.&nbsp; All about the
country there are scutch mills always at work.&nbsp; Nor is this
all; the country is full of weavers, who work away all day at
their hand-looms, lamenting probably the good old times before
steam had altered the mode of linen manufacture&mdash;when the
article in question was scarce&mdash;when wages were high, and
linen only the luxury of the very rich.&nbsp; The old hand-looms
remain, and people still get their living by working at
them.&nbsp; As I have said already, under certain conditions it
is necessary that they should remain.&nbsp; In the country round
here there are 900 of such weavers who are employed in connection
with the Bessbrook Mill.</p>
<p>Again, the size of the concern may be illustrated in another
way.&nbsp; It employs altogether nearly 4,000 hands, including
weavers, of which three-fourths are girls; girls, many of them
would otherwise have to walk the streets in rags, or be thrown
wild upon the towns, and add to their ever-increasing pauperism
and degradation.&nbsp; About &pound;200,000 worth of &ldquo;raw
material&rdquo; is worked up at Bessbrook every year, and above
&pound;50,000 per annum paid away in wages.&nbsp; Few get any
large portion; it passes away in small quantities to <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>boys and
girls.&nbsp; At Bessbrook the old proverb is still true:
&ldquo;Happy is the man who hath his quiver full of
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question is often asked, how are capital and labour to be
reconciled?&nbsp; Bessbrook shows.&nbsp; In that mill there is no
feeling of antagonistic interests.&nbsp; I believe once there was
a difficulty, but that was political, and not industrial.&nbsp;
The wild frenzy of Fenianism in its desolating course extended to
Bessbrook, but it was only a passing visitation, and it left no
trace behind.&nbsp; A year or two ago the writer was standing on
the steam-boat pier at Seraing, where the Messrs. Cockerell have
their grand works for the manufacture of rail-iron and
steam-engines.&nbsp; One of the heads of departments was with
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had you been here last week,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;you would have seen the soldiers here.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; was the
answer, &ldquo;we had a strike, and were obliged to call in the
military.&rdquo;&nbsp; Assuredly it is not pleasant for masters
and men when the military are called in to keep peace between
them.&nbsp; At Bessbrook not even the presence of a policeman can
be detected; and as to soldiers, they are as rare as
angels.&nbsp; In a land where discord runs high, where party
passions are strong, where intemperance adds fuel to the flame of
lawlessness, is not this saying a great deal?&nbsp; If some of
our manufacturers and employers of labour would visit Bessbrook,
I fancy they would not find their time thrown away.&nbsp; I
commend it to the notice of our social reformers.&nbsp; Plans on
paper are one thing, and in actual life another.&nbsp; It is well
to evolve a good idea from one&rsquo;s inner consciousness; it is
better to see it, as <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>at Bessbrook, successfully carried
out.&nbsp; A poet enthusiast would write glowingly of the place;
I merely tell a plain unvarnished tale, and testify of what I
seen and heard.</p>
<p>Since writing the above, I learn that in another part of
Ireland the plan which Mr. Richardson has pursued has been
carried out, and with great success.&nbsp; In the county of
Tyrone there is a district upon which the liquor traffic is
entirely prohibited.&nbsp; This district embraces an area of nine
or ten miles, covering three great public roads, inhabited by a
busy population of nearly 10,000.&nbsp; In that district it is
conclusively established that there is a complete immunity from
crime, and a poor-rate very much lower than that levied in
surrounding districts.&nbsp; In Ireland, at any rate, these facts
are being realised, and Irish M.P.&rsquo;s in large numbers,
especially in Ulster, help to swell the growing minority which
demand that the people of a district may be freed, if they wish
it, from the contamination of the beer-shop or the
public-house.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
